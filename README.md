# activity-prediction-app
iOS App for Human Activity Recognition (challenge for a PhD application). 
### Description
This simple iPhone App uses a trained LSTM on iPhone accelerometer data. The dataset I have used for training can be found
here: [motionSense](https://www.kaggle.com/malekzadeh/motionsense-dataset). The App uses a transformed Keras Model (.h5 -> .mlmodel), 
which is fed with motion accelerometer data (10seconds). 

### Requirements
> - iOS 12 (for CoreML to work)
> - Xcode10
### Installation
Install [TestFlight](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8) on your iPhone
